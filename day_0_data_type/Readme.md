Task

Variables named firstInteger, firstDecimal, and firstString are declared for you in the editor below. You must use the  operator to perform the following sequence of operations:

Convert secondInteger to an integer (Number type), then sum it with firstInteger and print the result on a new line using console.log.
Convert secondDecimal to a floating-point number (Number type), then sum it with firstDecimal and print the result on a new line using console.log.
Print the concatenation of firstString and secondString on a new line using console.log. Note that  must be printed first.

Output Format

Print the following three lines of output:

On the first line, print the sum of firstInteger and the integer representation of secondInteger.
On the second line, print the sum of firstDecimal and the floating-point representation of secondDecimal.
On the third line, print firstString concatenated with secondString. You must print firstString before secondString.

Explanation 0

When we sum the integers 4 and 12, we get the integer 16.
When we sum the floating-point numbers 4.0 and 4.32, we get 8.32. When we concatenate HackerRank with is the best place to learn and practice coding!, we get HackerRank is the best place to learn and practice coding!.
